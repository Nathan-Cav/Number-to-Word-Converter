# Number to Word Converter

A random project to create a Rust script that currently prints 1 to 1 million as words. I wasn't sure if there was any sample code that implements this so I thought I would put this up here for people to use. It could be interesting to adapt and publish this as a rust library at some point for the heck of it.

This is probably not the fastest and most efficient way of implementing this but it would be interesting to see how much the logic can be optimised and improved.
